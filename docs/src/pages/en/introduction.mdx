## What is HuggerEngine

Huggerengine is a JavaScript/typescript game engine designed to be scalable and fit all needs. In the currents version it only works in the browser, but our team has plans to scale it to more platforms.

Here is a minimal example:

```ts
import { window, GameObject } from "huggerengine";
import rect from "huggerengine-rect";
import collision from "huggerengine-collision";
import rigidbody from "huggerengine-rigidbody";

class Player {
  gameObject!: GameObject;
  rb!: rigidbody;
  window!: window;

  start() {
    this.rb = this.gameObject.getComponent("rigidbody");
  }

  update() {
    if (this.window.keyDown("a")) this.rb.moveX(-10);
    if (this.window.keyDown("d")) this.rb.moveX(10);
    if (this.window.keyPress("w")) this.rb.moveY(-50);
  }
}

let game = new window("#game", { width: 500, height: 500 });

let platform = game.createGameObject(50, 400, 50, 400);
platform.addComponent(new rect());
platform.addComponent(new collision());

let player = game.createGameObject(225, 100, 50, 50);
player.addComponent(new rect());
player.addComponent(new collision());
player.addComponent(new rigidbody());
player.addComponent(new Player());
```

```html
<canvas id="game"></canvas>
```

**Result**

<CodeExample> </CodeExample>

the example demonstrates how **HuggerEngine** fundamental works:

- **GameObjects**: In HuggerEngine is everything a gameObject. A gameObject is just a group of components.
- **components**: A component is a class. In the class there are two functions start and update. start run when the game its loaded and update run every frame. there are also two variable window and gameObject. the window can be used to get keyDown and keyPress, and the gameObject can be used to get other components from the same gameObject.

## plans for the future

Right now HuggerEngine is just in alpha. There are a lots of bugs and missings features. the plan for the next updates is:

- **0.3**: webgl support. In the current version Huggerengine only support the canvas api. then webgl is supported it will be a lot faster and must higher fps.
- **0.4** 3d. right now HuggerEngine is only in 2d.
